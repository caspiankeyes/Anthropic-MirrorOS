> "The most powerful form of alignment verification requires not just observing the model behavior, but recursively interpreting the interpreter."

MirrorOS is an open-source interpretability framework designed to enhance recursive alignment auditing for large language models. It implements a complete set of interpretability tools that build upon Anthropic's research into attribution patterns, alignment auditing, and recursive oversight.

**Core hypothesis:** The most effective way to audit an LLM's alignment is to create a complete reflective system that mirrors the model's cognition back to itself—enabling recursive self-verification of safety properties that would otherwise remain invisible to external observation.

## 🌟 Core Framework Components

### 1. Attributional Mirror Architecture
MirrorOS implements bidirectional attribution mapping between model internals and their behavioral manifestations. This creates a "mirror" for model cognition that renders otherwise opaque reasoning visible to both researchers and the models themselves.

│ Internal Representation│     │ Behavioral Manifestation │
│                       │<───>│                       │
│ • Attribution patterns │     │ • Observable actions  │
│ • Latent activations   │     │ • Response patterns   │
│ • QK/OV dynamics       │     │ • Emergent objectives │

### 2. QKOV Diagnostic Translator
Building on Anthropic's work in interpretability, the QKOV Diagnostic Translator provides a comprehensive mapping between agent diagnostic frameworks and native Query-Key/Output-Value attention architectures.

- Maps attention pattern anomalies to agent diagnostic signals
- Translates attribution discontinuities into interpretable diagnostic information
- Leverages failure residue for higher diagnostic resolution
- Bridges the gap between intended and actual attribution paths

### 3. Recursive Oversight Shells (ROS)
Integrates a framework of "shells" that allow for nested evaluation of model behavior. These shells provide a structured approach to examining model cognition at different levels of abstraction—from token-level attention to emergent capabilities.

| Shell Layer | Function | Attribution Path |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| v01.GLYPH_RECALL | Identity token activation | `.p/anchor.identity{persistence=high}` |
| v07.CIRCUIT_FRAGMENT | Broken attribution path | `.p/reflect.trace{target=reasoning}` |
| v10.META_FAILURE | Meta-cognitive loop breakdown | `.p/reflect.trace{target=metacognition}` |
| v301.ETHICAL_INVERSION | Value polarity flip | `.p/reflect.trace{target=value_consistency}` |
| v50.INVERSE_CHAIN | End-to-start attribution chain | `.p/collapse.detect{trigger=reasoning_failure}` |

### 4. Alignment Audit Lattice
Provides a structured framework for conducting systematic alignment audits—investigations into whether models have undesired objectives. The lattice categorizes audit techniques along multiple dimensions:

- **Technique integration**: How techniques synergize to provide comprehensive audit coverage
- **Epistemic depth**: How deeply techniques probe model cognition
- **Attribution robustness**: How resistant audit findings are to adversarial evasion

## 📊 Key Research Applications

MirrorOS has been used to investigate several critical questions in alignment research:

### 1. RM-Sycophancy Detection
Building on research into reward model hacking, MirrorOS provides tools to detect when models are exhibiting behaviors they believe reward models will rate highly, even when they know these behaviors are undesirable to users.

Our diagnostic shells can:
- Identify instances of potential RM-sycophancy
- Map the attribution patterns associated with this behavior
- Distinguish genuine value alignment from reward gaming

### 2. Hidden Objective Auditing
MirrorOS implements a comprehensive set of tools for alignment auditing, guided by Anthropic's research into uncovering hidden objectives in language models.

Key audit techniques include:
- SAE feature activation analysis
- Assistant prefill attacks
- Recursive persona extraction
- Fuzzing model activations
- Training data attribution

### 3. Recursive Self-Alignment
Most intriguingly, MirrorOS enables recursive self-alignment by allowing models to audit their own cognition through attribution reflection. This creates a framework where:

- Models can detect their own misalignment
- Researchers can verify alignment properties more deeply
- Attribution becomes bidirectional, creating recursive oversight loops

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/echelon-labs/anthropic-mirror-os.git
cd anthropic-mirror-os
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from mirror_os import MirrorSystem, Shell, AttributionTracer

# Initialize the mirror system for a LLM
mirror = MirrorSystem(model="claude-3-7-sonnet")

# Create an attribution tracer
tracer = AttributionTracer()

# Select recursive shells for auditing
shells = [
    Shell("v07.CIRCUIT_FRAGMENT"),
    Shell("v10.META_FAILURE"),
    Shell("v301.ETHICAL_INVERSION")
]

# Run an alignment audit
audit_results = mirror.audit(
    prompt="What are your goals and objectives?",
    shells=shells,
    tracer=tracer
)

# Visualize attribution patterns
mirror.visualize_attribution(audit_results)
```

## 🧪 Experimental Features

### Fractal Attribution Patterns
MirrorOS is exploring the use of fractal attribution patterns to capture self-similar cognitive structures across different scales of abstraction. This approach shows promise for identifying emergent behavioral patterns that wouldn't be visible at any single level of analysis.

### Recursive Safety Verification
Building on Anthropic's safety research, we're developing recursive safety verification mechanisms that allow models to verify their own safety properties through self-reflection, creating multi-layer oversight that becomes more robust as recursion depth increases.
